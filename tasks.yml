# name: Map Upload Location Feature
# description: >
#   Implement a feature on the upload page that allows users to upload a ZIP file containing location data. Map should also be displayed together with the marker.

# instructions:
#   - For the file upload functionality, allow users to upload a single ZIP file that must contain exactly one text file with location data (latitude/longitude coordinates and place names).
#   - Upon successful upload, display a confirmation popup for 3 seconds, then automatically add all the locations from the file to the user's map.
#   - If the ZIP file contains anything other than a single text file, show an error popup for 3 secondsinstead.
#   - Use the following format for the .txt file
#     Example:
#     Name, Latitude, Longitude
#     Suria KLCC,3.157324409,101.7121981
#     Zoo Negara,3.21054160,101.75920504
