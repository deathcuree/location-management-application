name: Map Location Form Feature
description: >
  Implement a feature on the map page that allows users to add and instantly view location markers
  without page reload, ensuring markers are user-specific.

instructions:
  - When the form is submitted:
      - Create a clickable marker at the given latitude/longitude
      - The marker should display the location name when clicked
      - The marker should appear instantly on the map without refreshing the page
  - Ensure location data is scoped per user:
      - Markers added by User A should only be visible to User A
      - Markers added by other users should not be visible
  - All updates should happen dynamically
  - Maintain proper error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., missing or invalid coordinates)
